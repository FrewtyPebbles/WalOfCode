<h2>About the Project:</h2>
<p></p>
	This project was a prototype for a modular ship building game idea that I had.
	The prototype features a space ship building mechanic that allows
	you to install parts on your ship's "core" and then drive your ship around 
	with tank-like controlls.  The dialogue system was added because I had the idea of how to write one while 
	working on the project.  This project as an opportunity to experiment 
	with perlin noise for the first time.  I used it to generate a random distrobution of tiles in an "asteroid"
	 as seen in the project images below.

<h2>Noteworthy Features:</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>A storage block can be added to the ship.  Each storage block has its own inventory that is tied to that block and can hold items inside.</li>
  <li>Player and non player ships utilize the same core object and hold all references to the ships blocks, along with attributes for the ship.</li>
</ul>
